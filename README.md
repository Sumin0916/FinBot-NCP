2024 NAVER Cloud Platform Capstone Project. An AI-powered chatbot built on NCP services that analyzes financial statements and provides insights through natural language interactions.

## About

FinBot-NCP is a financial analysis chatbot that leverages RAPTOR's tree-structured retrieval methodology and extends it with metadata-based clustering for enhanced financial document analysis. This project builds upon the RAPTOR framework while incorporating ideas from FinRAG to better handle financial data.

### Key Features (Coming Soon)
- Tree-structured retrieval for financial documents
- Metadata-based clustering (by sector, company, year)
- Natural language processing of financial statements
- Integration with NCP services
- Interactive financial analysis capabilities

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/finbot-ncp.git
cd finbot-ncp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Usage (In Development)

```python
# Example code will be added as development progresses
```

### Setting Up with NCP (Coming Soon)
- NCP configuration steps
- API key setup
- Service integration details
